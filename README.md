This program computes the time to send a packet using various IEEE 802.11 
standards. It also computes the throughput, as well as the time taken to send
or transmit 15 GB.

The program is called "wlan.py". The user should enter the number corresponding
to the option that they would like to choose at each stage. The user will choose
the following:

(1) The 802.11 standard; one of 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax (5 options)
(2) The data rate: either the maximum or minimum
(3) The transport protocol: either UDP or TCP

The relevant results will be printed to the console or terminal. At the end, the 
user will be asked if they would like to continue running the program (and investigate 
other 802.11 standards). If they enter "y" on the console, the program will accept 
further input. Any other input will cease the program.

Please note: Choosing 802.11ac will display information for BOTH 802.11ac Wave 1 and Wave 2.
