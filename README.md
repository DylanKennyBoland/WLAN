This program computes the time to send a packet in using various IEEE 802.11 
standards. It also computes the throughput, as well as the time taken to send
or transmit 15 GB.

The program is called "wlan.py". The user should enter the number corresponding
to the option that they would like to choose. The relevant results will be printed
to the console or terminal. At the end, the user will be prompted if they would like
to continue running the program (and investigate other 802.11 standards). If they enter
"y" on the console, the program will accept further input. Any other input will cease
the program.
